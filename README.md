# c4-draw.io

This file is in [.png (with embedded XML)](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/xml-in-png) format and can be edited directly in draw.io

It will not require a draw.io plugin popup as it is not a plugin - making it easier for others to edit the diagram.

## Icons

An easy way to find the icons image URL for the container shape is to search Google Images for your "technology name " + "logo SVG".

## Loading the shapes library from XML

The `c4.drawio.library.xml` is a library definition that can be imported into an existing draw.io diagram and provides the C4 model shapes as a library.

To import the shapes library, download the XML. Then, in draw.io, go to *File* -> *Open library from* -> *Device* and select the XML file from your device.

## Editing

Simply copy and paste shapes.

Select a shape and press Cmd + M (on Mac) to edit shape data.

If you like, save the file as .png (with embedded XML) for ease of viewing.
